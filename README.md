# DevOps Training Test

This is a very simple test for the DevOps training. It accesses the mocha server (assuming a Docker link to make this server available in the hosts file), opens the main page and checks it contains the text "Hello World" (without exclamation mark). This corresponds with the github.com/xebiaww/tryout repository which has an index.jsp containing the text "Hello World!" (with exclamation mark) which makes the test fail the first time you run it. The participant is supposed to fix the failing test by changing the application, not the test.
